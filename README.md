## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hi, I’m Anant Sharma

Turning ideas into code — learning, building, and growing every step of the way.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer and full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both **technology and business**.  
I hold a **B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering** and an **Advanced Diploma in International Business** from Red River College Polytechnic, Canada.

With 2+ years of professional experience, I build **user-centric digital solutions**, and I'm currently expanding my skill set into **machine learning and artificial intelligence**.

Outside tech, I’m deeply interested in **astronomy, physics, and music**, which keep me curious and creative.
