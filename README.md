## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer and full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both **technology and business**.

With 2+ years of professional experience, I build **user-centric digital solutions**, and I'm currently expanding my skill set into **machine learning and artificial intelligence**.

Outside tech, I’m deeply interested in **astronomy, physics, and music**, which keep me curious and creative.
